             <p class="card-text text-left">Robert received his Bachelor's Degree in Exercise Physiology from University of Illinois at Chicago and received his Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from Rosalind Franklin University/Chicago Medical School. <br><br>
              Robert has 18+ experience in both outpatient orthopedics and home health care treating a wide variety of orthopedic, sports, neurologic, and pain-related conditions amongst all age groups. His approach is to use both his exercise science training background along with his manual therapy expertise to return patients to the activities they love.  Robert has experience in manual therapy, cupping, functional dry needling (certified), instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization, Mulligan Manual Therapy techniques, and kinesio taping.  Robert's ability to get his patients from the most acute phases of an injury or from post-surgical recovery back to their prior level of mobility in a safe and efficient manner is one of his many skills that set him apart. <br><br>
              Robert has the unique ability to understand the Physical Therapy rehab process from the patient's perspective, as he has also been a patient, including during recovery from ACL reconstruction surgery.  Robert has a very caring personality and takes a sympathetic and empathetic approach to all patients, as his goal is to ensure he and his patients are working together to reach their goals.  Priding himself on personally investing in every patient he meets, Robert works to create individualized plans that take into account each patient and injury's unique needs.
